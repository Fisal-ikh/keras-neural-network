# keras-neural-network

This repository contains the code and results for the Keras MNIST Assignment, which aims to familiarize you with the Virtual Lab (Apporto) environment and Jupyter Notebook. You will gain hands-on experience using the Keras library to build and modify neural networks.

## Repository Contents

- `Doe_Jane_Assignment1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the initial model setup, experiments with modified parameters, and analysis of the results.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to:
1. Set up a neural network using the Keras library to classify the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
2. Experiment with different neural network parameters such as the number of epochs and batch size.
3. Analyze the impact of these parameters on the model's accuracy for the training, validation, and test datasets.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Access to the Virtual Lab (Apporto) environment. Use the link provided in the Virtual Lab Access module.
- Jupyter Notebook environment set up in Apporto.
- Python 3.x installed.
- Keras and TensorFlow libraries installed.

## Running the Code

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Launch the `Doe_Jane_Assignment1.ipynb` notebook in your Jupyter environment.

2. **Run the Initial Code**:
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the provided code, establishing baseline accuracy for the model.

3. **Experiment with Parameters**:
    Modify parameters such as the number of epochs and batch size in separate code blocks and observe their impact on model accuracy.

## Experiments and Results

### Initial Setup
- **Test Accuracy**: X.XX%

### Experiment 1: Varying Number of Epochs
- **Test Accuracy**: Y.YY%
- **Changes**: Reduced the number of epochs from 20 to 10.

### Experiment 2: Changing Batch Size
- **Test Accuracy**: Z.ZZ%
- **Changes**: Reduced the batch size from 128 to 64.

### Conclusion
Adjusting parameters like epochs and batch size shows their impact on the model's performance. Finding optimal values requires balancing between training time, model convergence, and accuracy on validation and test sets.
